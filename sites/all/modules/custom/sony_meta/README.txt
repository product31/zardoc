The Sony Meta Module lets authorized users add custom meta keywords, meta descriptions and html titles to any page on a Drupal site, and is compatible with global sites.

   1. Enable the module 'Sony Meta' (in the Sony BMG section of the modules list)
   2. Enable permissions 'add meta' - probably for admins and moderators
   3. Enable the 'Meta Information' block. Typically this should go in the sidebar, but for the homepage you may need to add it into the panel. This block checks users permissions automatically, so will never be visible to unauthorized users.

On every page there is now a block where you can add custom meta information. You can edit and delete this information from the same block.

There's an admin page in the 'Site Configuration' section that lists all pages with custom meta information - you can edit & delete from this page.
