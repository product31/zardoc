Friendlist - installation
---------------------------

Unpack the module in your "modules" directory.

INSTALLATION:

*. Place the module in the "modules" directory of your drupal installation

*. Enable this module by navigating to:

        Administer > Site building > Modules

   I *strongly* advice you enable all of the Friendlist-related modules.
   In particular, friendlist-ui is immensely important.

*. Go to Administer > User Management > Access control, and give 
   the permission "have relationships with friendlist" to the roles
   you like (probably authenticated users).

*. Configure the module by going to:

    Administer > Site configuration > Friend List UI Module

   The options should be self-explanatory: you can change the default
   messages, and rebuild the status cache

8. Enjoy!
