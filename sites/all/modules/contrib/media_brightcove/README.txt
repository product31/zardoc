Media: Brightcove

Initial Development by Aaron Winborn

This adds support for the custom premium players of Brightcove, available at
http://brightcove.com/.

Note that this is no longer a free service; they have removed their formerly
free network that used to reside at http://brightcove.tv/.

To use this module, you'll first need to install Embedded Video Field, which is
packaged with Embedded Media Field (from http://drupal.org/project/emfield).

Set up a content type to use a Third Party Video field as you normally would.
Also ensure that you have enabled the new Brightcove provider from the Admin
screen at /admin/content/emfield.
