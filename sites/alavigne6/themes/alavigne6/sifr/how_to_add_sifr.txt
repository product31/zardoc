sIFR FLASH TEXT REPLACEMENT
---------------------------
Version: sIFR 2.0.6

HOW TO ADD sIFR TO A THEME
--------------------------

1. Create a font .swf file containing the desired font.
   Open the sifr-template/sifr.fla file in Adobe Flash (version 8 or higher).
   Double-click in the middle of the file to edit the font used.
   Select a font to embed in the file.

   Important! Before saving make sure you embed the needed glyphs. Click the
   "Embed..." button next to the font select list and make sure the following
   options are selected:

   - Punctuation
   - Basic Latin (required for English)
   - Latin I (required for Danish, Dutch, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish)

   Other glyphs will need to be added if supporting Arabic, Greek, or Chinese.

2. Export the .fla file as .swf.
   Select File > Export > Export Movie...
   Save the file in this sifr directory, with the name of the font and the extension .swf

3. Turn on sIFR in the theme .info file.
   Open the theme .info file, and uncomment the lines (remove the leading
   semi-colon) for sIFR configuration. If the theme does not have lines for
   sIFR, use these as a template:

sifr[blocks][sFlashSrc] = sifr/stencil.swf
sifr[blocks][sSelector] = h2.block-title
sifr[blocks][sColor] = #333333
sifr[blocks][sLinkColor] = #0066CC
sifr[blocks][sHoverColor] = #000000
sifr[blocks][sBgColor] = #FFFFFF
; Enable wmode only if you must have transparency - loads faster without this
sifr[blocks][sWmode] = transparent

   The name of the "sFlashSrc" should be updated with the font file created in step 2.

   Note that sIFR does not inherit the colors of links from the site CSS,
   though other options like text-decoration and font-size are inherited.
   Also note that sIFR can only use hex style colors.

   (Bad)  sLinkColor = red;
   (Bad)  sLinkColor = #F00;
   (Good) sLinkColor = #FF0000;

   Any option supported by sIFR should be supported through the info file.
   You can find more information about these options at:

4. Clear the cache!
   Visit admin/settings/performance and click the "Clear all caches" button
   at the bottom of the page. This needs to be cleared whenever making changes
   to the theme .info file.

5. Style with CSS.
   All styles except color should be done in the style.css file. Edit as
   necessary to make the sIFR replacement match the site.
